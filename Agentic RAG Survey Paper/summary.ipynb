    "# Agentic Workflow Patterns\n",
    "- Agentic workflow patterns organize LLM-based systems using strategies such as prompt chaining, routing, parallelization, orchestrator–worker coordination, and evaluator–optimizer loops to improve accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability based on task complexity.\n",
    "- Each pattern is suited to different task complexities and processing needs, enabling dynamic collaboration between models or agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Prompt Chaining\n",
    "- Break complex task into sequence of steps, O/P of one become I/P of another.\n",
    "- Step by step reasoning\n",
    "- **Limitation:** Increase latency due to sequential processing\n",
    "- **Use when:** fix task\n",
    "- **Examples:** Generate text in one language than translate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Routing\n",
    "- Classify user input and sends them to the most appropriate \"model\" or \"prompt\"\n",
    "- **Best use:** Different query types are present\n",
    "- **Exmaples:** Custormer queries like support, refund and general information.\n",
    "- Handle simple query using simple models, and complex one by advance models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Parallelization:\n",
    "- Run miltiple \"independent task\" simultaneously, reduce response time.\n",
    "- Types:\n",
    "    - **Sectoring:** Different subtask run in parallel\n",
    "    - **Voting:** Multiple model generate o/p and check result\n",
    "- Reduce latency and increase reliability\n",
    "- Multiple code generation then check for any vulnerability\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Orchestrator-Worker:\n",
    "- A central orchestrator model dynamically decomposes tasks and assigns them to specialized worked models\n",
    "- Handles complex and unpredictable tasks.\n",
    "- **Best use:** Task structure is not predefined\n",
    "- **Example:** Real time research using multiple data sources\n",
    "- NotebookLM of google is a good eg.\n",
